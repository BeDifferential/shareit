# Share It

We've built social sharing buttons a few times and decided it was time to extract it to a package!  The goal of this package is to do a few things:

* Render proper OG and Twitter meta tags
* Support social sharing buttons with bootstrap-3 and font-awesome
* Expand to support other social platforms besides just twitter & facebook, in a configurable way
